      <div class="block_text_pre_h2">CUPPING</div>
      <h1 class="section_h1">The best cupping Burbank has to offer</h1>
      <div class="cup_img_block"></div>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What is cupping?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Cupping has been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine. It is a treatment that increases blood flow and circulation by creating suction on the skin. This helps to reduce pain and speed up recovery time from injury or illness.<br><br>There are several different cupping techniques, but the most common involves cupping glass or ceramic jars over an area where there is pain or muscle strain. The air inside them is sucked out using a fire or a pump, creating a vacuum effect which pulls the skin upwards towards the cup&#x27;s lip.<br><br>After cupping, the skin often looks reddish or bruised. These are called cupping marks and are thought to indicate where the stagnation in the body is located. They can last for up to a week, but cupping will usually leave no permanent mark on the skin.<br><br>Cupping is sometimes carried out alongside acupuncture treatment, but it can also be used by itself. It is nearly always painless, although there may be some mild discomfort when the cups are applied. The patient experiences an immediate sense of relief after cupping because their blood flow has been improved so much more quickly than with other types of treatment.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What does cupping treat?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) believes that cupping works on the meridians of the body which are invisible lines through which vital energy flows. By cupping, TCM practitioners hope to unblock the meridians so that vital energy can flow freely and healthily throughout the body.<br><br>When cupping is practiced upon various parts of the back it treats general conditions such as muscle pain, aches &amp; stiffness, poor circulation and cuts &amp; bruises just to name a few. Cupping also helps improve blood circulation while detoxifying the body.<br>‍<br>When cupping is practiced on a specific area of the back it can be used to treat a certain condition such as cupping the lower back to help with hip problems, cupping around the shoulder blades for upper back &amp; neck pain and cupping under the feet for headaches.<br>‍<br>In addition cupping is known to treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma and allergies when cupped on key points of respiratory system. Cupping also treats digestive disorders because cupped over acupuncture points along the large intestine meridian can aid in digestion thus reducing constipation.<br>‍<br>As you can see cupping has healing benefits that are beneficial to anyone no matter their age or their medical history or whether they are male or female. When executed correctly, cupping can be a powerful treatment for many conditions as this form of therapy has been used as traditional Chinese medicine treatment for thousands of years.<br></p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Is cupping safe?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Cupping is a safe and effective form of treatment. In fact, cupping is said to have no side effects apart from some possible bruising on the cupped area of skin as well as feeling temporary discomfort as the cupped muscles relax during cupping treatment.<br><br>However, it&#x27;s important that those who are being treated through cupping tell their cupping practitioner if they have any blood-related disorders, high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease so that practitioner can determine if they will be able to receive cupping treatments safely without putting their health at risk.<br><br>It&#x27;s also crucial that cupping practitioners know if their patients are taking any blood-thinning medications before they perform cupping therapy. Cupping may increase the risk of side effects and bruising when using such medications.<br><br>People with respiratory problems should seek medical advice before undergoing cupping treatments because cupping is said to enhance the flow of &quot;qi&quot; which can be a potential cause of pneumonia for those suffering from compromised lungs or other breathing conditions.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Does cupping hurt?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Cupping therapy within traditional Chinese medicine is a safe and completely painless form of treatment that can be used to address all manner of health problems.<br><br>Cupping is a treatment technique used to draw out blood congestion, improve the flow of chi around the body and help break up adhesions. The treatment doesn&#x27;t hurt because it&#x27;s done using suction rather than pressure - but there are different cupping techniques that can be used depending on what your practitioner wants to achieve.<br><br>Although cupping feels like a bit of a deep tissue massage, it has its own distinct feeling which you&#x27;ll get used to very quickly. The sensation of cupping is actually brought about by your blood being drawn towards the cup - but then when it&#x27;s removed suddenly, your blood vessels constrict and that&#x27;s what causes the sense of warmth that follows.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Does cupping have side effects?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">The international scientific consensus says no. Cupping therapy does not carry risks if performed by a qualified practitioner. While cupping can cause bruising which could be considered a side effect, it is largely considered cosmetic by most patients and practitioners.<br><br>The biggest risk with cupping therapy is that cupped individuals might try to do too much too soon after cupping treatment because they feel better than expected or because their pain level goes down so dramatically.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Why choose cupping?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Cupping therapy is based on the principle that cupping can improve circulation and remove toxins. This helps to heal diseases by stimulating specific points in your body which are linked directly to areas where you feel pain or discomfort. Once the cupped area becomes heated it will open up blood vessels, reduce inflammation and release muscle tension. This makes cupping an excellent treatment option for conditions like chronic pain, arthritis, migraines and even swollen joints after injury.<br><br>As cupping increases blood flow, this also improves lymphatic drainage . The lymphatic system is part of our immune system; it helps to remove waste from our bodies, fight infection and provides nutrition for cells. Additional cupping treatments can also strengthen the immune system as well as clearing skin disorders such as acne, eczema and psoriasis.<br><br>Cupping is a fantastic treatment option if traditional therapies have been unsuccessful or you want to avoid taking pharmaceutical drugs. It&#x27;s a safe, drug-free treatment that can help people of all ages with a range of health conditions. In fact cupping has been used for over 4000 years in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) where it was first recorded by ancient Egyptians.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Will insurance cover my cupping treatments?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">At Ryu Acupuncture Clinic, we accept most plans in and out-of-network insurance. Please call to see if your benefits apply.</p>
