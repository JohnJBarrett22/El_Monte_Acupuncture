      <h1 class="section_h1">The best traditional Chinese herbs Burbank has to offer</h1>
      <div class="tch_img_block"></div>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What are traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs are your standard medicinal herbs used to treat various ailments. TCM, traditional Chinese medicine, uses traditional Chinese herbs to balance what is thought to be the four elements of Earth, metal, water and fire.<br><br>There are several types of traditional Chinese herbs that are used in the TCM process including roots, flowers, fruit seeds and leaves. This form of medicine has several different names including herbalism or botanical therapy among other terms. Many traditional Chinese remedies have been around for centuries with some being so popular they&#x27;ve become household staples.<br><br>Traditional Chinese herbs are extremely popular due to their traditional use for centuries. While traditional Chinese medicines aren&#x27;t as mainstream as other westernized forms of medicine, traditional Chinese herbs still represent what many people find attractive about alternative medicine like herbal remedies.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What can traditional Chinese herbs treat?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs can treat anything from the common cold to obesity, infertility and even cancer. There are numerous traditional Chinese herbs used for the treatment of many problems. These herbs have a solid history of use and the success stories continue to pile up as this form of treatment becomes more mainstream.<br><br>Over the centuries, traditional Chinese herbs have been used to treat countless ailments. The reason that traditional Chinese herbs can heal so many different problems is because of the way they work on the body as a whole as opposed to traditional western medicines which focus on certain systems or organs.<br><br>In traditional Chinese medicine it is believed that there are energy flows within the body along pathways called meridians where life energy, or Qi, moves around the body. This Qi, or life energy, nourishes and protects us and brings us vitality and health and is made up of two opposing yet complementary forces: Yin and Yang. If this flow of vital energy becomes blocked due to an external pathogen, natural imbalance or internal injury then it can result in symptoms of physical illness.<br><br>Traditional Chinese herbs work alongside traditional Chinese medicine by nourishing the body when there is a deficiency and clearing away excesses when there is too much. This form of treatment restores balance and harmony between Yin and Yang, allowing the Qi to flow freely throughout the body once again protecting it from disease and bringing about optimum health. This allows traditional Chinese herbs to treat a wide range of problems both common and more serious including:<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="conditions_treated_list">
        <li><strong>colds &amp; flus</strong></li>
        <li><strong>digestive issues</strong></li>
        <li><strong>allergies</strong></li>
        <li><strong>asthma</strong></li>
        <li><strong>insomnia</strong></li>
        <li><strong>anxiety disorders</strong></li>
        <li><strong>depression</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="service_detail_para">A few traditional Chinese herbs that are commonly used include Tianqi (Gastrodia elata), Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), Baizhi (Angelica sinensis) and Xixin (Honey dates).<br><br>Tianqi is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese herbs. It helps with many diseases; however some known traditional treatments using tianqi include lowering blood pressure levels, clearing away toxins in the body related to heart disease, clearing away toxins in the body related to diabetes and clearing away heat in the body.<br><br>Danshen is most commonly known as a traditional Chinese herb that increases blood circulation by opening up blood vessels, strengthening cardiac muscle function and lowering cholesterol levels. It also treats symptoms such as hypertension, coronary artery diseases, cerebral vascular insufficiency, angina pectoris and more.<br><br>Baizhi, another traditional Chinese herb, has anti-inflammatory effects making it beneficial for traditional treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It is used traditionally to treat asthma and coughing spasms.<br><br>Xixin is a traditional Chinese herb that has been known to be highly effective in traditional treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Since ancient times, Xixin has been used, since it can lower high levels of the harmful LDL cholesterol and thus prevent atherosclerosis. It is also a traditional remedy for treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency, cerebral thrombosis, coronary heart disease and other peripheral vascular diseases. <br></p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Are traditional Chinese herbs safe?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs have been used in China and around the world for thousands of years. These herbal remedies use natural ingredients from plant, animal and mineral sources. Through time and testing, Chinese herbal medicine has been proven to be safe and effective by traditional standards.<br><br>Furthermore, traditional Chinese herbs must be assessed in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines to ensure reliable traditional Chinese herb therapies. Herbal remedies that do not meet these standards are considered unsafe and unreliable until proven otherwise.<br><br>In recent years, with all the additional testing and clinical trials, Chinese herbal medicine has really shown it&#x27;s value as a reliable alternative to conventional medicine. This is especially helpful for people who do not respond to traditional Western medical treatments. </p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Do traditional Chinese herbs taste bad?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">It depends.<br><br>A decent portion of traditional Chinese herbal teas taste bland because herbal ingredients mimic nature and usually taste like grass or plant matter raw. However, some traditional Chinese herbs are actually delicious when cooked in recipes.<br><br>Traditional Chinese herbal teas can be made into tasty drinks by adding sweeteners, though many people prefer to just take the herbal treatment as is.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Do traditional Chinese herbs have side effects?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbal medicines are used to treat a variety of illnesses, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, without causing any negative side effects like traditional Western pharmaceuticals may cause. Instead, traditional Chinese herbal medicine mixes work with the body&#x27;s natural energy flow to enhance its function without disrupting daily life activities.<br><br>Western pharmaceuticals usually come in the form of pills that people take every day to prevent disease, but they also carry some negative side effects like headaches or insomnia. This is why traditional Chinese herbal remedies offer a more effective approach because they do not have any adverse side effects and work in conjunction with traditional medicine.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Why choose traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs have been used for thousands of years to treat many health issues. Their traditional methods and medications remain effective today, and traditional herbalist doctors routinely use these alternative ways to practice medicine.<br><br>While traditional Western doctors can be helpful, traditional Chinese herbs are a better option for those looking to take an alternative route in treatment. Traditional Chinese herbs can help people recover from many different types of illnesses or injuries much more quickly than conventional medicine.<br><br>The ingredients used in traditional Western medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen contain harmful chemicals that negatively impact the liver over time. These chemicals function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (an enzyme responsible for pain regulation) or the COX-1 and COX-2 pathways. However, traditional Chinese herbs used in traditional treatment contain no chemicals that harm the liver in this way.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Will insurance cover my traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">At Ryu Acupuncture Clinic, we accept most plans in and out-of-network insurance. Please call to see if your benefits apply.</p>
