      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What is acupuncture?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Acupuncture is an ancient technique of traditional Chinese medicine that has been practiced for over 3000 years. It is a form of treatment that involves the insertion of fine needles into acupuncture points found along invisible meridians on the body. These acupuncture points are typically located around acupuncture channel lines or energy pathways in the body, which are also referred to as Jingmai &quot;经脉&quot; in traditional Chinese medicine. There are hundreds of acupuncture points dispersed throughout the body and each one is believed to have specific therapeutic properties that can help improve health.<br><br>The location where acupuncture needles are inserted at along these channels or paths called acupuncture points affects their therapeutic properties. The science behind acupuncture argues that stimulating certain acupuncture points can balance out opposing energies in order to restore proper function and well-being within several different bodily systems. Some acupuncture points are located on the extremities, like hands and feet, while some acupuncture points are located on the torso or head.<br><br>It is important to note that acupuncture is only one form of therapy administered within traditional Chinese medicine. Acupuncture may be used alone but it can also be used in conjunction with herbal remedies prepared using traditional Chinese herbs for treating certain conditions.<br><br>Acupuncture needles themselves are very thin, usually ranging from four to eight millimeters in diameter (though they can sometimes be thinner or thicker depending on the acupuncture point). Generally acupuncture needles range between seven to twelve centimeters in length depending upon the location of insertion, though acupuncture needles inserted into body cavities such as the ear or nasal cavities tend to have longer lengths.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What does acupuncture treat?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Acupuncture is known to treat a wide array of conditions thanks to its more than 3,000 years in history. This alternative medicine treatment targets the energy pathways of the body called &quot;meridians.&quot; These acupuncture treatments are based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) that treat imbalances in our bodies when certain acupuncture points are stimulated with needles or heat or electricity.<br><br>Acupuncture is used to alleviate many conditions ranging from back pain and infertility to headaches and arthritis. There has been much research demonstrating acupuncture&#x27;s value in treating common aches and pains, anxiety, depression, allergies, fertility issues in women and men, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nausea during chemotherapy treatment for cancer patients, asthma, even drug addiction. The World Health Organization recommends acupuncture as a treatment for over 40 acute and chronic conditions.<br><br>A larger breakdown of conditions treated with acupuncture can be found below:<br></p>

      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Is acupuncture safe?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Acupuncture is an all-natural, drug-free therapy that is safe and effective. According to the World Health Organization, there are no reports of acupuncture being harmful when used appropriately. The stainless steel needles used in acupuncture are pre-sterilized and disposed of after each treatment. The most common side effect is soreness, redness and bruising on the site of needle penetration.<br><br>Acupuncture has one of the best safety records in comparison to other forms of treatment. There has never been a reported case of an acupuncture needle causing infection to the patient. The needles that are used for acupuncture easily break and bend, meaning that if they were inserted incorrectly, they would not cause any harm as the patient would feel discomfort and stop the acupuncturist before insertion was complete.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Does acupuncture hurt?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Many acupuncture patients are afraid that acupuncture treatment will hurt. However, acupuncture is a painless procedure. The acupuncture needles used to treat muscles aches and pains are very thin (.22 mm) so they can slide through the skin without causing pain or damage. Patients may feel mild pressure when the needle penetrates the skin, but it should not be painful.<br><br>During acupuncture treatment, all acupuncture points are first disinfected with alcohol solution to cleanse them of bacteria and other contaminants that might cause infection if introduced into the patient&#x27;s body. Patients should also note that acupuncture needles are single-use needles, which means they are meant to be disposed of after one use only. This helps reduce the risk of infections from patient to patient.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Does acupuncture have side effects?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Acupuncture has no true side effects.<br><br>This is because acupuncture uses acupuncture needles, which are much smaller than anesthetic needles and do not pose the same threat as those used by doctors during surgery or for injections. Further, acupuncture points and meridians lie extremely close to each other, so acupuncture does not actually puncture the skin. Acupuncture simply stimulates nerve endings with its fine needles.<br><br>Typically side effects from acupuncture can include bruising and bleeding as a result of improper placement, which will not be a concern with Ryu Acupuncture. Sessions will last about 45 minutes and patients can resume normal activities immediately upon acupuncture treatment. Since acupuncture does not even puncture the skin, side effects are rare and mild compared to many other treatments available today.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Why choose acupuncture?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">The reason you should choose acupuncture as your preferred method of treatment is that acupuncture is safe, effective and has no side effects. Acupuncture&#x27;s success rate is about twenty times higher than that of traditional medicine.<br><br>Acupuncture is not invasive so it does not harm any healthy tissue or organ. Unlike some forms of traditional medicine such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, acupuncture does not have negative side effects and it poses no threat to life. Acupuncture treats the problem at its source while maintaining a high level of safety for patients. Acupuncture is also economical, as traditional medicine is quite costly.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Will insurance cover my acupuncture treatments?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">At Ryu Acupuncture Clinic, we accept most plans in and out-of-network insurance. Please call to see if your benefits apply.</p>
