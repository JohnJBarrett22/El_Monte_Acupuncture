        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Dr.Ryu is such a woonderful acupuncturist! He listens to your pain and treats you with care!<br><br>I really liked that they made sure I fill out the patient info form, and asked questions related to COVID. The facility had lots of sanitary equipments and I felt safe, since I&#x27;ve been very cautious with the virus. When I first made an appointment, I spoke with Jennifer and she was so helpful and answered all my questions at length.<br><br>My neck was tense from sitting on the desk for so long from work and my elbow nerve was bothering me when I leaned on my desk. Dr.Ryu asked many questions to understand me better and checked my pulse carelly. Then he put the needles on my hand and explained to me how certain needles are connected in my body part.<br><br>It&#x27;s been a week and now my elbow is feeling so much better and I definitely feel less tense on my left shoulder!<br><br>If you&#x27;re scared of needles just like me, Ryu Acupuncturist will change your perception about needles! I&#x27;ve gone to many acupuncturists and some of them put the needle in a wrong place and makes it hurt and uncomfortable even after the treatment. Dr.Ryu&#x27;s treatment was so smooth and gentle, and I feel so much better! I found it so hard to find acupuncturists who actually treats patients with care these days, and I&#x27;m so glad I found Dr.Ryu who I can trust.&quot;</p><img src="images/christina_k.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Christina K." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I am so grateful to Dr. Veronica Ryu who has improved my health and well-being so much . . . after suffering a really bad car accident where I was rear ended and suffered the worst whiplash and knee injuries.  I was in so much pain for months and nothing helped until I was referred to Dr Ryu.  She has a wonderful and gentle demeanor and really knows how to bring your body in balance.  I had no idea that acupuncture was so effective in treating pain.  I am a firm believer now and I encourage anyone dealing with chronic pain to see Dr. Ryu at least twice a week for 3 months and you will also be amazed at what she can do.  This office is a family affair which is great.  Dr. Ryu is assisted by her lovely daughter Jennifer while her son Alex mans the reception desk and her husband is also an Acupuncturist.  I find the family unity to be very profound and wonderful and makes it a very different experience than a regular Medical Office.  Forever grateful to have found Dr. Ryu and you will be too.&quot;</p><img src="images/maria_D.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Maria D." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;This is my second review because we were successful to have another child after receiving acupuncture and herbal treatment from Dr. Ryu! We had our first child in 2016 after getting both acpuncture and herbal treatment for 18 months. Our first IVF was successful. For our second child, I had treaent for about 4 months with Dr Ryu and had a cold transfer. Now our daughter is 3 yo and our son is 3 mons old. They&#x27;re both healthy as they can be and so am I. This is all thanks to Dr. Ryu. Not only I was able to get pregnant twice, my over all health was improved--mostly chronic back pain and severe allergy. Without his treatment, it would be very difficult to get pregnant in such a short period of time.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;In July of 2019, I completely lost my voice. After traditional western doctors either misdiagnosed and then finally &quot;couldn&#x27;t do anything about it, just wait and see&quot;, I started seeing Dr. Ryu. I could literally hear my voice improving after each treatment. I invested the time with him and he came through with amazing results. I truly believe that if I had &quot;waited&quot; and done nothing, I still would have no voice today. He is indeed the real thing. He would also take care of any other pains I had during these visits. I looked forward to treatment.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Hi, Everyone,<br><br>My name is, Vida, and I was referred to Dr. Ryu by my sister. I have had the best experience EVER!  I didn&#x27;t believe in acupuncture treatment, but after treating with Dr. Ryu my whole perspective has changed.<br><br>Dr. Ryu and his staff are very professional and welcoming. Dr. Ryu takes the time to explain everything to his patients in great details. He takes the time to listen and answer any questions or concerns the patient may have.  He is very honest and straight forward. He has helped my family and they have all had positive results.<br><br>My sister was having trouble getting pregnant and after three or four sessions with Dr. Ryu, she had a beautiful baby girl. Of course, she followed the treatment Dr. Ryu instructed.  My other sister was having trouble with her right knee and was not able to walk.  After a few treatments with acupuncture here pain went away permanently. Dr. Ryu also helped my father who had liver problems and right knee pain. As of today, my father hasn&#x27;t forgotten Dr. Ryu&#x27;s treatment and remembers how helpful the treatment was for him.      <br><br>As for myself, I had a problem with my wrist, due to repetitive work. I had this awful painful cyst on my right wrist. With a few aggressive treatments Dr. Ryu was able to help me. The cyst and the pain is gone. My wrist is doing so much better and I can go back to typing at work. He did an amazing job with my wrist and I am very happy with the results.  <br><br>I definitely recommend Dr. Ryu to anyone with these similar problems.<br><br>-Vida&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Short version: Dr. Ryu is amazing; when Western doctors couldn&#x27;t figure out the reasons for my infertility, Dr. Ryu really came through for me, helping me to get pregnant twice. I&#x27;m so glad I put myself in his hands. He helped me through some of the most difficult health-related moments of my life.<br><br>Long version: I went to Dr. Ryu for fertility issues after a long bout of infertility followed by a miscarriage at age 36; after long batteries of tests, doctors couldn&#x27;t find anything &quot;wrong&quot; with me, so we decided to try again, this time with the addition of an acupuncture routine. I found Dr. Ryu through my health insurance. Within 4 months of biweekly acupuncture visits, I became pregnant again (the previous pregnancy had taken 1.5 years to accomplish), though this was followed by an early miscarriage. After that second miscarriage, I was depressed and discouraged and decided to take a break. After another year of infertility, I decided to try IVF (thinking it was my &quot;last shot&quot;) coupled with acupuncture from another recommended (more expensive) clinic. When two rounds of IVF failed, my husband and I were gutted financially and emotionally. I sought therapy and more or less gave up on my chances of having a biological child. Still, there was a part of me that had a tiny bit of hope. Six months after the failed IVF, I decided to return to Dr. Ryu, who was realistic with me. He told me that his treatments would at least help return my hormones to normal after the craziness of IVF hormone therapies, and at best also help me to become pregnant (unlike the Western docs, he kept telling me I wasn&#x27;t &quot;old&quot; and that he had helped plenty of women at my age, 38 going on 39, to get pregnant). I didn&#x27;t have much hope for the latter possibility, but knew that his treatments had helped to regulate my hormones before so I focused on that goal and quickly saw results. I treasured my visits to his office. Dr. Ryu is a very sympathetic person, and his life advice was always reassuring. He approached my situation with the positivity and hope that I sometimes lacked. I stopped worrying about becoming pregnant and focused on becoming healthy and living a happy life. And so I was surprised when four months later, almost exactly like the first round of visits with Dr. Ryu two and a half years earlier, I was pregnant again. I hated &quot;graduating&quot; and moving on to an OB/GYN (though luckily I found an amazing one) because the care in Dr. Ryu&#x27;s office had been such a wonderful consolation for me. Every week, I&#x27;d come in for two visits to focus on myself and my well-being. The first trimester was nerve-wracking, but I&#x27;ve made it to the halfway point of this pregnancyand am finally hopeful about my prospects for having my own biological child. I can&#x27;t thank Dr. Ryu and his team (especially Alex at the front desk) enough. Dr. Ryu deals with the most difficult cases, because people usually come to him after lacking helpful resolutions with Western doctors. He approaches each of these difficult cases with knowledge, care, and so much experience. He does this work because he cares and he is constantly refining his techniques via courses and conferences. I can&#x27;t speak to Dr. Ryu&#x27;s many other specialties, but I can attest to the fact that when it comes to fertility issues, Dr. Ryu is the person to see.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I&#x27;ll be honest. We were pretty much on the fence as to whether acupuncture would work. And my first trip to the doc for headaches was a little worrisome. My second blew my mind and made me a believer - a back ache I&#x27;ve had for years, seriously gone since that one visit and that was more than a year ago. This doc knows his stuff. And he&#x27;s got a witty sense of humor too. The best part of all this is that we believed he helped my wife get pregnant. Her treatments relaxed her, his home-made teas appeared to shock her system and now we&#x27;re expecting!

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Dr. Ryu has single handedly been responsible for restoring my body back to balance. I started seeing him after months of unexplained chronic fatigue which traditional Western medical practitioners could not understand. After just 1 visit, I felt a considerable difference and honestly can&#x27;t recommend him enough. One month and a few treatments later and I feel like I&#x27;m back to my optimal self. I&#x27;m now going for maintenance and will continue to do so. His office is efficiently run, and his times are flexible -- a big advantage for a working professional. There is nothing more I can ask for. Thank you, Dr. Ryu.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I have been suffering with chronic pain for years. My only relief came from painkillers and they would make me a zombie. Then I found Dr. Ryu and he said he could help me. I no longer rely on painkillers to get through the day and I rarely take them. This man is a magician. I&#x27;ve been able to work full time and not wish for death every night. I can enjoy my life again. Thanks Doc.<br><br>Shout out to Lucy at the front desk.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I came In on a Friday morning, 5 days past my due date. I had tried going to a chiropractor, eating &quot;the salad&quot; in north hollywood, massage and walking around, baby just wasn&#x27;t dropping.<br><br>Dr Ryu did what he did, and i sat there for 15 minutes. He recommended another appointment the following day if nothing happened so i scheduled one. Dr Ryu was kind and affordable given my insurance covered it so i didn&#x27;t mind the extra trip if needed. Truthfully wasn&#x27;t expecting anything but there were a few yelp reviews that left me hopeful. I will say, later that night my water broke and contractions started. I tried a couple things with my husband at home too ;) so it&#x27;s hard to say what exactly did the trick.

As I write this, I have zero tinnitus and full hearing!<br><br>I was recommended to acupuncture for a stiff shoulder/neck by my GP and after a few sessions for Dr Ryu and getting full mobility back in my neck, I casually asked Dr Ryu if he could do something about my ears.

Let&#x27;s just say I regret not taking my mom to Dr Ryu sooner. Alex, the front office manager was so accommodating and got my mom in on Saturday morning mind you I called on Friday afternoon. My mom was on a lot of pain medication after a trip to the ER because of her back she couldn&#x27;t stand or sit or even walk. I got her in to Dr. Ryu&#x27;s office and let&#x27;s just say with Dr. Ryu taking one look at my mom and how she was walking. He knew exactly what was wrong with her. My mom is the last person on earth to believe alternative medicines, but with her intense 3 times a week sessions with Dr. Ryu now she is a believer and now we recommend him to anyone and everyone. My mom&#x27;s back has improved greatly and it wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without DR.Ryu. A heartfelt thank you to him for being so honest and cracking jokes to liven up the mood and providing his wealth of knowledge. Thank you so much Dr. Ryu my mom is a big believer of your magical hands and you have gained us as patients even for maintenance .&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;IT WORKS!! For 10 years I was poisoning my body with MD prescribed medication with side effects I had to deal with taking medication for severe indigestion (acid reflex) and severe menstrual cramps. Dr Ryu explained that the underling problem for my menstrual cramps is my indigestion. He suggested that we focus on that first. I did Acupuncture twice a week and took herbs that were hand picked by him and put together specifically for my body conditions. Within 2 months I gradually stop taking my prescription medicine and continued with the herbs and acupuncture only once a week. After 4 months, my digestion is better then ever and I feel more energy, I sleep soundly and true enough my period cramps have signicantly reduced. My husband is also going to him now after seeing my improvement and being free from prescription medication which only mask the problem. Chinese herbal medicine has no side effects and it gets to the root of the problem to cure it and acupuncture activates our meridians to energies and assist the body to naturally heal itself. I&#x27;m so grateful to Dr Ryu for keeping this ancient knowledge alive and helping people to heal naturally.&quot;</p><img src="images/charmaline_A.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Charmaline A." class="testimonial_image">

I had never gone to one so I was a bit hesitant.

He customize your experience according to your health needs and never once pushed any herbal medicine or anything else that I didn&#x27;t need.<br><br>Overall I would highly recommend him and have to some of my coworkers.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;My husband and I were diagnosed as unexplained infertility in our mid-thirties. In terms of Western medicine, our infertility specialist couldn&#x27;t find anything wrong with us. However, I was suffering from severe allergy, chronic back pain from sports injury years ago, and constant coldness and fatigue. I was also under the great stress and feeling depressed from not being able to get pregnant.<br><br>When I saw Dr. Ryu, I already had acupuncture treatment with herb medicine by other acupuncturist 5 months in prior and 2 IUIs in the past 12 months. Dr. Ryu listened to me and told me after checking my pulse and tongue that my blood circulation and digestive system were weak. I was explained that I couldn&#x27;t get the sleep that I needed to re-charge my energy.<br><br>From the very first acupuncture treatment, I felt the immediate effect. I was able to sleep a little better for the first time in a long time. As Dr. Ryu said to strengthen my system first, I began to sleep better, gain more energy, and improve allergy symptoms. Then, he worked to re-activate my reproductive system, as well as managing my chronic back pain. After about 6 months, we tried 2 more IUIs, which resulted in no pregnancy. I was told that I was one of the most difficult cases. After 18 months, we decided to try IVF and were successful on the 1st try!<br><br>I highly recommend Dr. Ryu for infertility treatment and beyond. His acupuncture treatment and herb medicine were the factor for me to get pregnant in such a short period of time despite of my many health concerns. We&#x27;re now almost 7 months pregnant, and I&#x27;m much healthier than when I started.<br><br>It&#x27;s been a quite journey for my husband and myself, but we&#x27;re very grateful to receive the treatment and emotional support that needed most from Dr. Ryu. I went to many acupuncturists in the past 20 years, but his skills and knowledge are top-notch. He&#x27;s the best acupuncturist I&#x27;ve ever been treated. I believe that you could easily understand what I mean after your treatment.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I have just started treatment with Dr. Ryu and I am so happy! A bit of background,  I have been dealing with a spine  injury for over 12 years. I have tried everything short of surgrey and yet everyday I woke up in total pain. After just one vist, my pain was gone. I kid you not. I have just completed my second session and again no pain. I am so happy. Dr. Ryu has been a God send. Please give him a try, you will be so happy.<br><br>Side note, the needles barely hurt. I am a huge wuss when it comes to needles and I can barely feel these. It hurts more when he pokes me to find out where I hurt so he can mark the spot where he needs to put the needle than the needle itself.&quot;</p><img src="images/julia_B.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Julia B." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I&#x27;ve been going to Dr.Ryu for about 2 years now. Start of with infertility issue, I saw him once a week for acupuncture and also took Chinese medicine. I was able to get pregnant in about 5-6 months of treatments. Then Dr.Ryu helped me with labor induce and breastfeeding issues. He treated mastitis, and plugged milk duct. He even stayed open late for me to come in that one time since the plugged milk duct was an urgent issue and very painful. Now I bring my 6 months old baby in to get help with sleep and bow movement. With a little baby, he doesn&#x27;t leave the needles in. It was 8 priks, one on each finger, in and out. My baby wasn&#x27;t crying. She was just about to and it was over. So I guess it was not that painful for her. Dr.Ryu is a miracle worker. I&#x27;m very thankful I found you, Dr.Ryu.&quot;</p><img src="images/sara_U.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Sara U." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;My Mother was in pretty bad shape.  She is 80 and on top of multiple ischemic strokes last year, she had a persistent profound sciatica for almost three months.  The pain was debilitating and my Mother was rapidly losing her mobility and her will to live.  She began cussing like a sailor, mostly at herself.  <br><br>She is a member of Kaiser and several things were tried, including PT and hydrocodone, but nothing worked for her.  I read that scientific studies indicated that acupuncture treatment of sciatica is most effective.  So I got a referral for acupuncture from Kaiser for my Mom.  By the time we had our first visit to Dr. Ryu, my Mother&#x27;s sciatica had become so bad that she was unable to sleep more than three hours lying down in bed.  This had gone on for about six nights.  <br><br>After the first acupuncture treatment by Dr. Ryu, my Mother improved so much that she slept all night in her bed.  Dr. Ryu stated that the first treatment was just to treat the inflammation.  Two weeks later, two appointments per week and my Mother declared that the pain from sciatica was pretty much gone.  Dr. Ryu really knows his stuff and is very easy to deal with.  I can&#x27;t recommend him highly enough.&quot;</p><img src="images/craig_N.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Craig N." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Many thanks to Dr.Ryu for stopping my persistent hiccups in the very first session itself . I have been suffering from persistent hiccups for 10 days continuously and that was very big relief . I was desperately looking for some remedy that could relieve me from the discomfort . Thats the time my wife suggested to go for acupuncture treatment . With the help of yelp reviews, we identified and met Dr.Ryu . I told him about my past history of acid reflux , digestive issues and currently with the persistent hiccups . Dr. Ryu made me understand that my digestive process isnt going well due to lack of good sleep and work stress . He suggested me for a better life style and stopped the persistent hiccups with just an hour of treatment . Later with couple of more treatment , i am feeling better , more energetic along that i am trying to bring a good lifestyle in my routine as per his suggestion . I am very Glad that i met Dr.Ryu on the right time to get relieved from the digestion disorders.  <br><br>Regarding the Insurance coverage , well since i had a platinum insurance plan with United Health care insurance it help me to get a complete coverage with 0$ co pay .&quot;</p><img src="images/senthil_K.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Senthil K." class="testimonial_image">

I was 39 weeks 5 days pregnant and was trying little things here and there to naturally jump start my labor. I had my first session at 9 am that morning and Dr. Ryu scheduled me to come back on Monday and have consecutive sessions after that, until I finally go into labor. At approximately 11:30 am while having brunch at restaurant, my mucous plug was released and my water broke! My husband immediately brought me to the hospital and I went into active labor within the next 3 hours after that. Not only was the treatment effective for me, Dr. Ryu was great and was honest when it came to explaining and answering questions.

Dr. Ryu is the real deal - educated, thoughtful, thorough and caring.  He gets real pleasure from tackling a problem and finding a resolution, and I feel like I have a healthcare provider who is actually on my team, trying to make my life better.  I think his reviews speak for themselves - all five stars.  If you&#x27;ve ever been curious about acupuncture, and how it might help you, I definitely would recommend you try Dr Ryu!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

We have had game night in the past and he has always wanted to do his own thing but he is wanting to be included!!!

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Over a period of 8 months my menstruel cycle was erratic and irregular, due to stress from a traumatic incident. My cycle was sometimes early, sometimes late, compromised by the development of ovarian cysts and at the end was not stopping after two months. I visited the office of Dr. Ryu to get help to stop my menstruel bleeding after a solid two months. I was feeling tired, weak, depressed, depleted and overall not well. After a few visits to see him twice a week and with the addition of a tailor made herbal tea for my symptoms, he was able to stop my two month cycle and end my menstruel bleeding. I highly recommend Dr. Ryu&#x27;s office for any ailment but specifically in my case for feminine menstruel cycle irregularities. Not only did he stop the symptom of my irregular cycle, he is working to help repair the source of my stress that is comprimising the wellness of my digestive, menstruel and mental health. His office is extremely professional, his staff is exceptional and attentive and he has a very warm, compassionate and friendly approach.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;My husband has had anxiety attacks for years now due to a traumatic incident in his past.  His attacks occur at any point and time - on the freeway, movie theater etc.  Its very scary to witness I can&#x27;t imagine what he goes through.  In any case he was resigned to taking some very strong meds to numb the feeling as soon as he feels he is going to experience an anxiety attack.  So deciding to remove as much drugs from his system, I found Dr. Ryu (pronounced Dr. U ) and the rest shall we say is history.<br><br>Dr Ryu has a very blunt sense of humor and is a straight shooter which both of us like.  He made sure I understood what my husband was going through and how real the attack is for him.  Witnessing an anxiety attack is a completely different experience from going through one.  It was hard for me to understand why we needed to go to Urgent care or the ER when he had a bad one.  He is only 30 so even though he thinks he is having a heart attack, realistically you know he is not - no heart disease , young and in shape etc.<br><br>He has seen Dr. Ryu for three months now and hasn&#x27;t had an anxiety attack since the accupuncture treatments started.  Also Dr. Ryu has been treating him for snoring issues and that has calmed down as well to the point of where I don&#x27;t have to move to the couch in the middle of the night!<br><br>I highly recommend Dr. Ryu as a holistic approach for whatever you may be experiencing.  He is extremely knowledgeable and a funny guy :)<br><br>You&#x27;ll love Rennie as other Yelpers have mentioned she is very sweet and very good with handling paperwork if you are using insurance.

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I had never tried Acupuncture prior to visiting Dr. Ryu. I was a little nervous with the idea of being poked with needles but I had heard good things about Ryu and made an appointment. If you have never tried acupuncture before, I suggest you give it a shot. The needles are so small that you don&#x27;t really feel most of them. It does work and it is drug free relief, which is fascinating. I have now been there at least a dozen times and I think Ryu&#x27;s acupuncture is a lifesaver for my back pain. It is great to know that when my back pain flares up I have somewhere to go to get relief. They are very accommodating with last minute requests and they work with my insurance.

I went to a physical therapist, an orthopedic surgeon, and I was even considering going to a neurologist because they are nerve experts. It was suggested that I try acupuncture and I was fortunate enough to have found Dr. Ryu. Not only did I feel a complete 180 degree difference after only one session with Dr. Ryu, but I was able to get feeling, sensation, and movement in my arm again.

My OB threatened to induce labor with pitocin--totally against my wishes for a natural, drug-free birth since I had GD and he wouldn&#x27;t let me go past 41 weeks. I went with my husband on a visit and we chatted briefly about how I was overdue. Dr. Ryu mentioned his success with inducing labor so it was worth a try instead of drug induction or mandatory c-section. I went in for 4 consecutive sessions and went into labor during the Sunday his office was closed. Was able to labor at home for two days and arrived at the hospital at 7 cm in active labor!<br><br>We really owe Dr. Ryu a huge thanks for helping with healing my husband&#x27;s back, inducing my labor, and allowing me to have manageable labor pains. We&#x27;re blessed with a happy, alert little baby boy. My husband was able to lift his little guy and helped me postpartum as his back healed quickly.&quot;</p><img src="images/dee_T.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Dee T." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I suffer from Gout, and was in a lotta pain! The indomethacin was not working and I was desperate for help! I called Dr Ryu and asked if he could help me.He said come in at 6:00pm and I will see you.Normally Dr Ryu closes his office at 6, but he stayed late to help me. I get to his office at 5:45pm and fill out some paper work, then Dr Ryu sits down with me and explains his treatment and we discuss my health history.The Gout was attacking my right knee and I could hardly walk on it.Dr Ryu examined my knee and marked all the locations. He then proceeded to place needles in my knee.Almost 30 needles were used!He had me relax for 30 minutes before he removed the needles.Within the next several hours the pain had begun to subside to a very tolorable level. I saw Dr Ryu 2 times a week for a total of 9 treatments.Each time the pain lessened.This was back in March 2012. Dr Ryu I cant thank you enough!His treatments are very aggresive but effective!&quot;</p><img src="images/calvin_F.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Calvin F." class="testimonial_image">

He listens to your problems and concerns,  he offers up real solutions, and there&#x27;s no pressure to buy stuff outside of your budget.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles, but within a couple of days of that first session, all of my hand pain was gone!  I was blown away.  All of that pain and discomfort I was worried I was going to have to live with just disappeared after one visit!  I highly recommend Dr. Jay if you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful practitioner.  My fiance&#x27; is now visiting him for some ailments, and loves him as well.  Five stars aren&#x27;t enough.  Thank you, Dr. Jay!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Dr. Jay Ryu is a miracle worker. My left sciatica has been causing me so much pain that I would cry. I had no relief after several weeks of massages and suggested stretches and exercise. I was very frustrated and depressed.  I had seen Dr. Jay years ago, but so much time had passed that I wasn&#x27;t too sure where his office was located. I was so pleased to find his practice through an Internet search. I made my appointment with him and he was able to see me immediately.  After my first visit the pain was less. After only three visits I have relief and I am getting better. I don&#x27;t like taking pain medication to mask the pain and I want the issue resolved. Dr. Jay is healing me and getting me back to normal.  Dr. Jay&#x27;s knowledge and experience makes me comfortable. He can explain everything before, during and after the acupuncture procedure. He helps you understand how your body works with the  treatments and what you can do in between visits to continue the healing process. He is fabulous and I recommend him to anyone that is interested in getting help and issues resolved.  I can&#x27;t explain it as well as he does, but I know that it WORKS and I am grateful that I was able to locate him and get my treatments.&quot;</p><img src="images/lisa_D.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Lisa D." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;Wonderful and stunningly effective!  I am so happy and grateful to have met Dr. Jay Ryu L. Ac., Ph. D., and to have been treated by him.   We first met 3 years ago, and this year after some time away, I came to him with a seemingly intractable medical problem.  In a very short course of treatment, Dr. Ryu eliminated persistent abdominal dysfunction and severe pains, pains that had deeply distressed me and completely stumped western-medicine doctors for 9 months.<br><br>I started having sharp abdominal pains late last Winter, sometimes rolling on the floor in discomfort, and they persisted every day through the Spring, Summer and Fall.  I am a man who can put up with a lot, but I was so frightened by what I experienced that early on I took an emergency air ticket home just so I could get immediate medical treatment.  Over the months, I was seen by 7 different western-medicine doctors, whom I liked and whom I found to be generally good physicians.  Two of my closest friends are General Practitioners, and they helpfully guided me in finding the best doctors.  Despite extensive and increasingly costly scans and tests and a battery of prescription medicine, none of the doctors or their treatments could do anything for me, or the relentless pain, despite their best intentions.  With ever-more-sophisticated scans, probes and drug treatments in store for me, I found myself able to be seen by Dr. Ryu in Los Angeles (Burbank) again.  I wish I&#x27;d seen him much earlier!<br><br>I was stunned and delighted by the wonderful results I experienced with Dr. Ryu - right afterwards I discovered myself laughing with relief.  After one intensive session of acupuncture (for me, I couldn&#x27;t care less about acupuncture needles or what to me is their tiny discomfort), the pains I&#x27;d lived with every day for three-quarters of a year subsided dramatically.  After a day or two, I was still wary, doubting that the success could last - but it did!  I came back for a bit more treatment just to be sure, as I had been considering cancelling upcoming travel just out of fear I&#x27;d be stuck with these pains and end up having to seek treatment overseas.  After Dr. Ryu&#x27;s successful acupuncture my plans are &#x27;on&#x27; and I often find myself forgetting I ever had the abdominal pains that just recently had driven me to distraction.<br><br>I found Dr. Ryu pleasant, highly attentive and willing to help.  I also found him pleasant and humorous, but your mileage may vary.  I suppose that it helped that I came with a &quot;good attitude&quot; as I&#x27;d met him before and had confidence in him.  I&#x27;m not a complainer in general and feel it&#x27;s in my own interest, while keeping my head about me, to cooperate with medical professionals so as to work as a &quot;team&quot; with them.  For sure, other problems may require more extensive treatment, depending on the nature of each one; for an unrelated problem, now that I have the abdominal pains out of the way, I plan to start on a course of Dr. Ryu&#x27;s very-high-quality herbs.  His questions and diagnosis are clearly driven by his intelligence, and by his genuine desire to achieve success for the patient.  Over the years I have experienced medical professionals of every stripe and credo, including some dear favorites of mine, but Dr. Ryu is &quot;the best&quot; in his field I&#x27;ve encountered.  I consider myself very lucky to have been introduced to him and to have been treated by Dr. Ryu!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this man!!!!! It honestly does not get any better. He is the best doctor I have ever seen and the best acupuncturist that I have ever been to. He soars above the rest. Dr. Ryu is one of the most genuine human beings I have met and he is a doctor in Los Angeles. Go figure. He is so kind and compassionate....and an amazing listener. He wants to help you!!!! He wants to succeed in helping you. That is his goal. Keep in mind that this is acupuncture, so it is not an instant fix, but he will help you get there .... and pretty quick.  I initially went in for back issues that no other doctor in 15 years could or wanted to help with. I was barely able to walk 4 weeks ago. Today, I barely notice an issue. Then came an issue a few weeks ago with emotional stress.  Thank God I had Dr. Ryu on my side. He is helping me more than he even knows. He is so humble. Honestly, he really is not that expensive, despite what some of the other reviews said. What you get from Dr. Ryu in time, knowledge, and compassion is worth a heck of a lot more than what he charges. He is not like the others. It is not about the money. It is about helping out another human being. You would be a fool not to go to Dr. Ryu. I can only say &quot;trust me&quot; on this. You will have no regrets.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;When I initially went to Dr Ryu, I was experiencing extreme fatigue, chronic digestion problems, headaches and very painful period cramps. I knew that going to bed at 8pm and still feeling tired in the morning was not normal for a 31 year old but no doctor could explain why. During a preliminary evaluation, Dr Ryu asked me thorough and detailed questions. I immediately realised that he wanted to understand the whole picture of my health, unlike previous Western doctors I had seen. Through weekly accupuncture and herbal medicine (for a couple of months), I have begun to feel VERY different. I now feel refreshed in the morning after a great night&#x27;s sleep and have energy throughout my day. I no longer have digestion issues; no more bloatedness, diarrhea or constipation. My hair is shinier, my nails stronger. The duration of my periods are shorter and I no longer suffer pain from menstrual cramps. Life feels so good again.  I owe so much to this professional, caring and very talented doctor!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I began seeing Dr. Ryu for a very deep and persistent cough. Every time I get a cold I would develop a terrible cough that would last for 2 months. I have had this problem for 40 years. Dr. Ryu treated me with a herbal tea for some 3 months. Since the treatment I have had 2 colds and I have not had the cough. My other experience with Dr. Ryu is I recommended a friend who has a son with Epstein Bar syndrome. His son had 2 or 3 attacks a year that caused him to be very weak with little energy. He took an herbal tea for 4 months and he has not had a attack since taking the herbs. This same friends son had an athletic injury to his knee. He had a medial collateral tear in his right knee. Dr Ryu treated him with acupuncture 2 times a week for 3 weeks. He was running again in  4 weeks and has not had any problems with that knee&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;I have recurring coughs.  I&#x27;ve tried all the standard treatments including inhalers, pills, cough syrup etc. and none of it works.  I went to Dr. Ryu and he gave me some extremely bad tasting herbal tea and told me to drink it twice a day for a month.  I nearly gave up cause the stuff tasted so bad but I soldiered on and it worked.  The down side is that the month&#x27;s supply of tea cost $600.  If you have the cash it&#x27;s definitely worth it to go see him.&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

But it was 2 weeks and i still had pain in my ankle and swelling, so i thought i would give it a try.<br>   First visit I came in on cructhes for a sprained ankle. In about 30 mins , I was walking without my crutches with little pain and little discomfort. 2nd visit I was there for about 30mins, the next day I noticed a big difference., my swelling came down and i had little pain. My final visit, i virtually had no more pain and swelling.  I highly  recommend Dr. Ryu!&quot;</p><img src="images/default_testimonial.png" loading="lazy" alt="The default Yelp profile image when a user does not provide one, which is just a silhouette of a person." class="testimonial_image">

        <p class="testimonial_para">&quot;If you&#x27;re concern has ever been that you may have to have any kind of surgery for a problem you have, first go to Dr. Ryu and he will take care of your problem without surgery.<br><br>I&#x27;m just fed up with western medicine and am convinced that it is a conspiracy. I myself suffered from kidney stones and it wasn&#x27;t until 12 years later of kidney stones and never solving the problem, that I finally went to Dr. Ryu. He did a few treatments and I haven&#x27;t had any more problems.<br><br>I also flew my sister up here from New Mexico because she was told she had to have a brain surgery for someting called tri-geminal neuralgia. Her pain was excruciating. She went to Dr. Ryu and her pain went away.  <br><br>He is amazing. I will always refer my friends and family to him. Not only is he competent, he is kind and caring. He really explains the whole process to you and really helps you to understand how to heal your sickness, not just to cover up the symptoms.<br><br>Go to Dr. Ryu no matter the physical ailment. You won&#x27;t regret it.<br>I noticed that one of the previous reviews said that the needles hurt like hell, that is not true. I&#x27;m sure it depends on the treatment as well but in my experience the treatment has never been uncomfortable.<br>Peace, - PJ&quot;</p><img src="images/jose_L.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Profile picture of Jose L." class="testimonial_image">
