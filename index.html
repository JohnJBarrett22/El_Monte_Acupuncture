We had our first child in 2016 after getting both acpuncture and herbal treatment for 18 months. Our first IVF was successful. For our second child, I had treaent for about 4 months with Dr Ryu and had a cold transfer. Now our daughter is 3 yo and our son is 3 mons old. They&#x27;re both healthy as they can be and so am I. This is all thanks to Dr. Ryu. Not only I was able to get pregnant twice, my over all health was improved--mostly chronic back pain and severe allergy.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-answer-text">The first visit to Ryu Acupuncture Clinic usually begins with your acupuncture practitioner taking a detailed history. Since traditional Chinese medicine takes a more holistic approach that&#x27;s different from Western medication, you may be asked questions about things like your sleep habits or tolerance level for heat/cold before diagnosing any ailments we believe could have been causing illness in your system - but these seemingly unimportant details actually help provide better treatment options.<br><br>Depending on your condition, you may be subjected to an examination of the tongue and pulse - a major diagnostic technique in traditional Chinese medicine. Using all information obtained during your medical history exploration and exam, your licensed practitioner will determine the cause of your symptoms. Therefore ,it is important to understand not just what was found by the exam, but also how these symptoms manifested themselves so that treatment can take place properly.<br><br>Based off all the gathered information, needles will be inserted into specific acupuncture points. Our acupuncture sessions generally do not require patients to disrobe for treatment and can typically be done with some clothing manipulation around the treatment area. Where necessary, electrical stimulation and/or heat therapy may be used as well in order enhance the therapeutic effect during this process.</p>

            <p class="faq-answer-text">Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment option for many common conditions. It has been shown to help relieve pain, anxiety/depression struggles, shoulder pain, as well allergies or asthma attacks that come on suddenly due in part from the stressor being too much when it&#x27;s not expected - all while providing relief with no side effects. The World Health Organization recommends acupuncture be used by patients who suffer from over 40 acute ailments including backaches, headaches, kidney stones, intestines disorders and more.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p class="faq-answer-text">Every person is different and will respond differently to the acupuncture techniques. Some people experience an immediate reaction, while others may take longer before they notice any effects at all. The best way you can tell if treatment has worked or not though are changes in your body - it might be dramatic for one patient but subtlety beneficial on another&#x27;s behalf.<br><br>The length of time it takes to get relief from your condition may vary depending on the individual and their type. Acute conditions can be resolved in a few treatments, while chronic disorders require more work-time before they&#x27;re alleviated fully or indefinitely. Painful sensations will also lessen with treatment for functional issues such as allergies; however progress will be slower than expected because this condition has been developing over an extended period of time.</p>
