      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What are traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs are your standard medicinal herbs used to treat various ailments. TCM, traditional Chinese medicine, uses traditional Chinese herbs to balance what is thought to be the four elements of Earth, metal, water and fire.<br><br>There are several types of traditional Chinese herbs that are used in the TCM process including roots, flowers, fruit seeds and leaves. This form of medicine has several different names including herbalism or botanical therapy among other terms. Many traditional Chinese remedies have been around for centuries with some being so popular they&#x27;ve become household staples.<br><br>Traditional Chinese herbs are extremely popular due to their traditional use for centuries. While traditional Chinese medicines aren&#x27;t as mainstream as other westernized forms of medicine, traditional Chinese herbs still represent what many people find attractive about alternative medicine like herbal remedies.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">What can traditional Chinese herbs treat?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs can treat anything from the common cold to obesity, infertility and even cancer. There are numerous traditional Chinese herbs used for the treatment of many problems. These herbs have a solid history of use and the success stories continue to pile up as this form of treatment becomes more mainstream.<br><br>Over the centuries, traditional Chinese herbs have been used to treat countless ailments. The reason that traditional Chinese herbs can heal so many different problems is because of the way they work on the body as a whole as opposed to traditional western medicines which focus on certain systems or organs.<br><br>In traditional Chinese medicine it is believed that there are energy flows within the body along pathways called meridians where life energy, or Qi, moves around the body. This Qi, or life energy, nourishes and protects us and brings us vitality and health and is made up of two opposing yet complementary forces: Yin and Yang. If this flow of vital energy becomes blocked due to an external pathogen, natural imbalance or internal injury then it can result in symptoms of physical illness.<br><br>Traditional Chinese herbs work alongside traditional Chinese medicine by nourishing the body when there is a deficiency and clearing away excesses when there is too much. This form of treatment restores balance and harmony between Yin and Yang, allowing the Qi to flow freely throughout the body once again protecting it from disease and bringing about optimum health. This allows traditional Chinese herbs to treat a wide range of problems both common and more serious including:<br></p>
      <ul role="list" class="conditions_treated_list">
        <li><strong>colds &amp; flus</strong></li>
        <li><strong>digestive issues</strong></li>
        <li><strong>allergies</strong></li>
        <li><strong>asthma</strong></li>
        <li><strong>insomnia</strong></li>
        <li><strong>anxiety disorders</strong></li>
        <li><strong>depression</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="service_detail_para">A few traditional Chinese herbs that are commonly used include Tianqi (Gastrodia elata), Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza), Baizhi (Angelica sinensis), and Xixin (Honey dates).<br><br>Tianqi is one of the most commonly used traditional Chinese herbs. It helps with many diseases; however some known traditional treatments using tianqi include lowering blood pressure levels, clearing away toxins in the body related to heart disease, clearing away toxins in the body related to diabetes and clearing away heat in the body.<br><br>Danshen is most commonly known as a traditional Chinese herb that increases blood circulation by opening up blood vessels, strengthening cardiac muscle function and lowering cholesterol levels. It also treats symptoms such as hypertension, coronary artery diseases, cerebral vascular insufficiency, angina pectoris and more.<br><br>Baizhi, another traditional Chinese herb, has anti-inflammatory effects making it beneficial for traditional treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It is used traditionally to treat asthma and coughing spasms.<br><br>Xixin is a traditional Chinese herb that has been known to be highly effective in traditional treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. Since ancient times, Xixin has been used, since it can lower high levels of the harmful LDL cholesterol and thus prevent atherosclerosis. It is also a traditional remedy for treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency, cerebral thrombosis, coronary heart disease and other peripheral vascular diseases. <br></p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Are traditional Chinese herbs safe?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Traditional Chinese herbs have been used in China and around the world for thousands of years. These herbal remedies use natural ingredients from plant, animal and mineral sources. Through time and testing, Chinese herbal medicine has been proven to be safe and effective by traditional standards.<br><br>Furthermore, traditional Chinese herbs must be assessed in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) guidelines to ensure reliable traditional Chinese herb therapies. Herbal remedies that do not meet these standards are considered unsafe and unreliable until proven otherwise.<br><br>In recent years, with all the additional testing and clinical trials, Chinese herbal medicine has really shown it&#x27;s value as a reliable alternative to conventional medicine. This is especially helpful for people who do not respond to traditional Western medical treatments. </p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Do traditional Chinese herbs taste bad?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Many acupuncture patients are afraid that acupuncture treatment will hurt. However, acupuncture is a painless procedure. The acupuncture needles used to treat muscles aches and pains are very thin (.22 mm) so they can slide through the skin without causing pain or damage. Patients may feel mild pressure when the needle penetrates the skin, but it should not be painful.<br><br>During acupuncture treatment, all acupuncture points are first disinfected with alcohol solution to cleanse them of bacteria and other contaminants that might cause infection if introduced into the patient&#x27;s body. Patients should also note that acupuncture needles are single-use needles, which means they are meant to be disposed of after one use only. This helps reduce the risk of infections from patient to patient.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Does traditional Chinese herbs have side effects?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">Acupuncture has no true side effects.<br><br>This is because acupuncture uses acupuncture needles, which are much smaller than anesthetic needles and do not pose the same threat as those used by doctors during surgery or for injections. Further, acupuncture points and meridians lie extremely close to each other, so acupuncture does not actually puncture the skin. Acupuncture simply stimulates nerve endings with its fine needles.<br><br>Typically side effects from acupuncture can include bruising and bleeding as a result of improper placement, which will not be a concern with Ryu Acupuncture. Sessions will last about 45 minutes and patients can resume normal activities immediately upon acupuncture treatment. Since acupuncture does not even puncture the skin, side effects are rare and mild compared to many other treatments available today.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Why choose traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">The reason you should choose acupuncture as your preferred method of treatment is that acupuncture is safe, effective and has no side effects. Acupuncture&#x27;s success rate is about twenty times higher than that of traditional medicine.<br><br>Acupuncture is not invasive so it does not harm any healthy tissue or organ. Unlike some forms of traditional medicine such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, acupuncture does not have negative side effects and it poses no threat to life. Acupuncture treats the problem at its source while maintaining a high level of safety for patients. Acupuncture is also economical, as traditional medicine is quite costly.</p>
      <h2 class="service_detail_h2">Will insurance cover my traditional Chinese herbs?</h2>
      <p class="service_detail_para">At Ryu Acupuncture Clinic, we accept most plans in and out-of-network insurance. Please call to see if your benefits apply.</p>
